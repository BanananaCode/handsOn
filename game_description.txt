Welcome to the ultimate game of 3D PONG!
There are two modes to play.
The first mode uses your mouse to move the paddle.
The second mode uses the movement of you're hand in real life!
If you are using the second mode, ensure that you enable your camera,
turn on the lights in your room, and start playing!
Do you're best to move the paddle and deflect the ball to reach your highest score!
